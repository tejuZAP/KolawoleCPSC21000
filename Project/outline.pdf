My endgoal is to create a website that stores personal projects of mine with an easy to understand UI.

Summary
I have made a website before so I want to see what I can do in order to innovate what i was able to do. 
Two things that I want to try is customizing the look of the website more and also having a changelog that 
that shows all the different updates implemented.

Challenges to Complete
1. I've done websites before so I would like to make something that surpasses them
2. I would like to implement a changelog that shows the updates made to the website

Week-by-Week
- Week 3: Come up with the basic skeleton of the website.
- Week 6: Set the style of the website
- Week 9: Come up with the changelog showing the different updates
