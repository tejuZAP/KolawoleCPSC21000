Project Name: Digital gallery

End Goal and Summary:
For the personal project i had the idea to do a website where i can archive art or different kinds of personal projects of mine. I'd like to be able to achieve a pleasant to look at and interact with user interface.

Weekly Tasks:
The weekly tasks would essentially be to build up the website. First the basis for it and how it works and then bit by bit trying out new things to add style to it or make it more intuitive.

Technologies:
For now I expect to use Javascript, CSS, HTML, and Python as the languages that will make up the code for the site.

Challenge:
A challenge will be to implement a changelog that chronicles the changes to the site over time.
